# infra-tools

Go-based tooling for the infra-deployments repository. These tools analyse
the ArgoCD kustomize structure to detect which environments, clusters, and
components are affected by a set of file changes.

## Usage as GitHub Action

This repository can be consumed as a GitHub Action in workflows:

### Environment Detection (env-detector)

```yaml
- uses: aurelbalteaux/infra-tools@main
  with:
    command: env-detector
    pr-number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Render Diff (render-diff)

```yaml
- uses: aurelbalteaux/infra-tools@main
  with:
    command: render-diff
    base-ref: origin/main
    output-mode: ci-summary,ci-comment
```

See [action.yml](./action.yml) for all available inputs and outputs.

## Usage as Standalone CLI

### env-detector

Detects which environments and clusters a PR affects by building ArgoCD
ApplicationSet overlays, resolving kustomize dependency trees, and matching
changed files. Used in CI to auto-label PRs.

```bash
# Dry-run (prints affected environments/clusters without calling GitHub)
go run ./cmd/env-detector --repo-root /path/to/infra-deployments --dry-run

# Full run (labels a PR)
go run ./cmd/env-detector \
  --repo-root /path/to/infra-deployments \
  --pr-number 123 \
  --github-token "$GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  --repo owner/repo
```

Key flags:
- `--base-ref` — git ref to compare against (default: `main`)
- `--overlays-dir` — path to ArgoCD overlays (default: `argo-cd-apps/overlays`)
- `--cluster-labels` — include `cluster/<name>` labels
- `--dry-run` — print results without calling GitHub
- `--log-file` — write debug logs to a file

### render-diff

Computes and displays the kustomize render delta for components affected by
the current branch's changes. Shows what will actually change in each
environment when your PR merges.

```bash
# Build the binary
cd infra-tools
make build

# Diff against merge-base with main
./bin/render-diff

# Force colored output
./bin/render-diff --color always

# Write .diff files to a directory
./bin/render-diff --output-dir ./diffs

# Open all diffs in a visual diff tool (folder comparison)
./bin/render-diff --open

# Use a specific diff tool
DIFFTOOL=meld ./bin/render-diff --open

# Explicit base ref
./bin/render-diff --base-ref origin/main
```

Key flags:
- `--base-ref` — git ref to compare against (default: merge-base with `main`)
- `--color` — color output: `auto` (default), `always`, `never`
- `--open` — open diffs in `$DIFFTOOL` or `git difftool` (directory comparison mode)
- `--output-dir` — write per-component `.diff` files to a directory
- `--output-mode` — output format (comma-separated): `local` (default), `ci-summary`, `ci-comment`, `ci-artifact-dir`
- `--log-file` — write debug logs to a file
- `--version` — print version and exit

#### CI output modes

The `--output-mode` flag selects how output is formatted. Multiple modes can
be combined with commas (e.g., `--output-mode=ci-summary,ci-comment,ci-artifact-dir`).
When multiple modes are specified, each mode runs independently — if one fails,
the remaining modes still execute. The CI modes are used by the `pr-render-diff`
GitHub Actions workflow and are not intended for local use:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `local` | Progressive colored diffs to stdout (default) |
| `ci-summary` | Posts a summary on the Checks section of the PR (collapsible per-component diffs) |
| `ci-comment` | Posts a summary table as a PR comment via the GitHub API |
| `ci-artifact-dir` | Writes raw `.diff` files to `--output-dir` for upload as an artifact |

The `ci-comment` mode reads its configuration from environment variables
rather than CLI flags, so these details are not exposed to local users:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | API token for authentication |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | Repository in `owner/repo` format |
| `PR_NUMBER` | Pull request number to comment on |

If any of these are missing, `ci-comment` falls back to printing the comment
markdown to stdout.

## Project structure

```
infra-tools/
  cmd/
    env-detector/        CLI entry point for env-detector
    render-diff/         CLI entry point for render-diff
  internal/
    appset/              ArgoCD ApplicationSet YAML parser
    deptree/             Kustomize dependency tree resolver
    detector/            Core detection logic (overlay building, file matching)
    git/                 Git operations (diff, worktree, merge-base)
    github/              GitHub API client (PR labels, PR comments)
    kustomize/           Kustomize build wrapper
    renderdiff/          Render diff engine (parallel builds, unified diffs, YAML normalization)
  Makefile               Build, test, lint targets
```

The `internal/` packages are shared between both tools. The `detector` package
provides the detection pipeline that both tools build on: it constructs
ApplicationSet overlays, resolves kustomize dependency trees, and matches
changed files to affected components.

## Development

Prerequisites: [Go 1.24+](https://go.dev/dl/)

```bash
cd infra-tools

# Build all binaries (output to bin/)
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Run linter (downloads golangci-lint on first run)
make lint

# Fix lint issues automatically
make lint-fix

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Running tests

```bash
# All tests
go test ./...

# Specific package with verbose output
go test -v ./internal/renderdiff/

# With coverage
go test ./... -coverprofile cover.out
go tool cover -html cover.out
```

### Adding a new internal package

1. Create the package under `internal/`
2. Write tests alongside the code (`*_test.go`)
3. Import it from the relevant `cmd/` entry point
4. Run `make lint` to verify

### CI

The tools are tested by `.github/workflows/test.yaml`, which runs on pull
requests and pushes to main, executing `make build`, `make test`, and `make lint`.

Container images are published to quay.io/aurelbalteaux/infra-tools by
`.github/workflows/publish-image.yaml` on main branch pushes and version tags.
